# Linux in the pocket

This project brings bare-metal Linux desktop and services to smartphones.

Plenty of smartphones are sadly lying around, waiting for a second life. Most of them provide enough resources to be recycled as mini computers. With a variety of sensors, cameras, microphones, they are great battery-powered maker boards. As smartphones often support USB OTG, even more peripherals to be added for desktop use. 

This is only possible with software that allows customization. This repository shows how to build such a system using existing free and open-source software. Only because I had a spare one, I am using [this model](https://www.samsung.com/levant/smartphones/galaxy-grand-prime-g531h/) as reference. Similar work is possible with other smartphones and other embedded devices.
